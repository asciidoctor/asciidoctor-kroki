== Ways of using link:https://github.com/Mogztter/asciidoctor-kroki[asciidoctor-kroki]

For this example, you must install `asciidoctor-kroki` so it is accessible to your Antora installation.
If you have installed Antora globally, you can run:

[source]
----
npm install -g asciidoctor-kroki
----

See the `package.json` for an alternate more self-contained installation method.

The HTML pages in a browser will look rather repetitive.
It is perhaps more interesting to look at the HTML source to see the effects of the different configurations.

Currently, this example only explores PlantUML source format diagrams.
With the exception of `ditaa` source, for which only `png` output is supported, other diagram types should have similar capabilities and configuration.

=== xref:sourcelocation.adoc[Choices for source diagram location]

This page demonstrates the possible locations for the diagram source using a `[plantuml]` block.

=== xref:embedding.adoc[Choices for generated HTML]

This page demonstrates some choices for the style of generated HTML.
Since `data-uri` is not officially supported by Antora, and currently does not work for `png` impages pending an asciidoctor upgrade, there are no `data-uri` examples.

=== xref:embeddingblockmacro.adoc[Choices for generated HTML, using the block macro]

This demonstrates the same choices but using the `plantuml::` block macro with a reference to the diagram source in `partials`
